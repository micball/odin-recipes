        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This buttermilk syrup comes from Katie Madrian's grandma. It's one of the most delicious syrups you will ever eat.  Gauranteed.</p>
            <p>This goes especially well on good cinnamon french toast, and even better on a delicious batch of pumpkin waffles.</p>
            <p>A word of caution before you make this: use a bigger pan than you think necessary, much bigger.  Adding the baking soda causes the syrup to foam a lot, and if your pan isn't large enough, you're going to make a very sticky mess.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 Cup white sugar</li>
                <li>1/2 Cup buttermilk</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat sugar, buttermilk, and butter in a saucepan over medium heat until the mixture starts to boil, about 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>Remove saucepan from heat and stir baking soda and vanilla into the buttermilk mixture.</li>
            </ol>
